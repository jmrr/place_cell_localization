###Evaluation code for "Biologically inspired localization based on neural network training of place cell models"

####Usage
* Run `initialize.m`

* Run any of the evaluation scripts:

  1. Parameter evaluation. For now only varying the threshold is evaluated: `parameterEvaluation.m`
  2. Method evaluation: evaluate different appearance-based methods on the neural for sub-localization: `methodThresholdEval.m`
  3. Evaluate method for neural net regression and max() in one routine outputting a table: `methodTable.m`
  4. Evaluate method and threshold in one routine: `methodEvaluation.m`
